### Hello and welcome all! ðŸ‘‹

I am a passionate learner and dedicated professional transitioning from teaching to the dynamic fields of technology and data analysis. My journey has been shaped by love, resilience, and an unwavering commitment to personal growth.

After a fulfilling career as a teacher, I decided to explore a new path that combines my love for problem-solving with the ever-evolving world of coding. Now, as a proud mom to a baby girl, I balance nurturing her growth and fostering her love for learning at home while embracing the challenges of advancing my own technical skills.

I have successfully completed Data Analysis with Python courses at CODE:YOU and freeCodeCamp. My focus areas include Python, SQLite, and Tableau, through which I aim to develop robust data-driven solutions.
